LiteNote
==============================

- LiteNote is a personal project with a goal to have a fully functional
    note taking, reminder making, and to-do listing web application
    
- Will have a clean, minimalistic UI and simple/obvious to use

- As described: you can take notes, jot down a to-do list, set a note as 
    a reminder, set a to-do list as a reminder, or use all these features 
    in tandem with each other
    
- Reminders are sent via email to your designated email address

- User's will sign up with their email address as their username

- The app will be in a SPA format with very few links (profile/settings)

- The home page will have the user's notes, reminders and to-dos listed
